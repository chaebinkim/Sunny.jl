    Units.meV
    Units.theory

The unit system is implicitly determined by the definition of two physical
constants: the vacuum permeability ``μ₀`` and the Bohr magneton ``μ_B``.
Temperatures are effectively measured in units of energy (``k_B = 1``) and time
is effectively measured in units of inverse energy (``ħ = 1``). The default unit
system, `Units.meV`, employs (meV, Å, tesla). Select alternatively
`Units.theory` for a units system defined so that ``μ₀ = 1`` and ``μ_B = -1``,
which produces a Zeeman coupling of ``-g 𝐁⋅𝐒``.
