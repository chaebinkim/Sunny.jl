#
# A crystal spacegroup consists of a set of symmetry operations. Each symop is
# defined by an orthogonal (rotation or reflection) matrix R and a translation
# vector T. The symop transforms every atom position `x` to a new one `x‚Ä≤ = Rx +
# T`, but leaves the crystal as a whole invariant. Consider some bond b=(i,j),
# defined as an ordered pair of atoms, not necessarily in the same crystal unit
# cell. Suppose this bond carries an exchange interaction of the form `S_i·µÄ J
# S_j`. After applying a symop defined by (R, T), the bond b=(i,j) maps to a
# transformed bond b‚Ä≤=(i‚Ä≤,j‚Ä≤). This new bond must carry an exchange interaction
# of the form `S_{i‚Ä≤}·µÄ J‚Ä≤ S_{j‚Ä≤}`, where J‚Ä≤ is related to J, as we will now
# show. Besides mapping the atom j to a new position j‚Ä≤, the symop also
# transforms its spin vector from `S_j` to `S‚Ä≤_{j‚Ä≤} = R S_j`. Similarly, `S_i·µÄ`
# maps to `S‚Ä≤_{i‚Ä≤}·µÄ = S_i·µÄ R·µÄ`. The energy along a bond, however, is invariant
# under the symmetry transformation, so we require `S_i·µÄ J S_j = S‚Ä≤_{i‚Ä≤}·µÄ J‚Ä≤
# S‚Ä≤_{j‚Ä≤}`, or
#
#   `S_i·µÄ J S_j = S_i·µÄ R·µÄ J‚Ä≤ R S_j`.
#
# This equation must be valid for arbitrary `S_i` and `S_j`, which implies `J =
# R·µÄ J‚Ä≤ R`, or equivalently,
#
#   J‚Ä≤ = R J R·µÄ
#
# because the matrix R is orthogonal. The conclusion is that specifying the
# exchange matrix J for one bond implicitly constrains the exchange matrices J‚Ä≤
# for all symmetry equivalent bonds.
#
# Often a symmetry operation will map a bond b into itself, or into the same
# bond but with atom positions reversed. The existence of such symops constrains
# the space of allowed exchange matrices J for the bond b. Specifically, we
# require
#
#   (1)  J = R J R·µÄ   or   (2)  J·µÄ = R J R·µÄ
#
# for every symop `s = (R, T)` that maps `b` into `b` (constraint 1), or into
# `reverse(b)` (constraint 2). The intersection of all such constraints defines
# the symmetry-allowed space of exchange matrices J. The allowed matrices can be
# expressed as a linear combination of basis matrices because all constraints
# are linear in J.
#
# It is convenient to express the constraints (1) or (2) in the form `F J = 0`,
# where F denotes the linear operator such that `F J = R J R·µÄ - J` or `F J = R J
# R·µÄ - J·µÄ`. Here, we are viewing the 3√ó3 matrix J as a flattened 9-dimensional
# vector, and F as a 9x9 matrix. In the first case, `F = R‚äóR - I`. In the second
# case, we should replace `I` by the suitable transpose operation,
# `transpose_op_3x3`, defined explicitly below.
#
# Any linear combination of "vectors" (3x3 matrices) in the null space of F,
# i.e. `F J = 0`, satisfies the symmetry constraint (1) or (2) for the given
# symop. The singular value decomposition
#
#     F = U Œ£ V·µÄ
#
# can be used to produce an orthogonal basis for this null space. It is spanned
# by columns v of V corresponding to the zero singular values. The space spanned
# by v equivalently represented as a projection matrix,
#
#     P = v v·µÄ
#
# When there are multiple constraints (F1, F2, ... Fn) we should take the
# intersection of the spanned spaces of P1, ... Pn. To calculate this
# intersection, form the product of the projectors:
#
#     P = P1 P2 ... Pn
#
# The allowable J values correspond to the eigenvectors of P with eigenvalue 1.
# An orthogonal basis for this space can again be calculated with an SVD.


# A 9x9 matrix that, when applied to a flattened 3x3 matrix (viewed as a
# 9-dimensional vector), generates the transposed 3x3 matrix in flattened form.
