# Welcome

Sunny provides powerful tools to simulate equilibrium and non-equilibrium
magnetic phenomena from microscopic models. It also facilitates calculation of
the dynamical spin structure factor $\mathcal{S}(ùê™,œâ)$ for direct comparison to
experimental scattering data.

[_**Feature highlights**_](@ref "Why Choose Sunny?") include symmetry-guided
modeling, interactive visualization, and more accurate approximations to quantum
spin dynamics.

[_**Browse the tutorials**_](@ref "1. Spin wave simulations of CoRh‚ÇÇO‚ÇÑ") to get
started. See also [SpinW ports](@ref "SW01 - FM Heisenberg chain") for
traditional spin wave theory.

[_**Library Reference**_](@ref "Library Reference") lists all functions and
their doc-strings.
