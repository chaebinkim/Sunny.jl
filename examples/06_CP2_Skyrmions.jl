# # 6. Dynamical quench into CP¬≤ skyrmion liquid
#
# This example demonstrates Sunny's ability to simulate the out-of-equilibrium
# dynamics of generalized spin systems. We will implement the model Hamiltonian
# of [Zhang et al., Nature Communications **14**, 3626
# (2023)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39232-8), which supports a
# novel type of topological defect, a CP¬≤ skyrmion, that involves both the
# dipolar and quadrupolar parts of a quantum spin.
#
# Beginning from an initial high-temperature state, a disordered gas of CP¬≤
# skyrmions can be formed by rapidly quenching to low temperature. To model the
# coupled dynamics of dipoles and quadrupoles, Sunny uses a recently developed
# generalization of the Landau-Lifshitz spin dynamics, [Dahlbom et al., Phys.
# Rev. B **106**, 235154 (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.106.235154).

# The Hamiltonian we will implement, 
# ```math
# \mathcal{H} = \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} J_{ij}( \hat{S}_i^x \hat{S}_j^x + \hat{S}_i^y \hat{S}_j^y + \Delta\hat{S}_i^z \hat{S}_j^z) - h\sum_{i}\hat{S}_i^z + D\sum_{i}(\hat{S}_i^z)^2
# ```
# contains competing ferromagnetic nearest-neightbor and antiferromagnetic
# next-nearest-neighbor exchange terms on a triangular lattice. Both exchanges
# exhibit anisotropy on the z-term. Additionally, there is an external magnetic
# field, $h$, and easy-plane single-ion anisotropy, $D > 0$. We begin by
# implementing the [`Crystal`](@ref).

lat_vecs = lattice_vectors(1, 1, 10, 90, 90, 120)
basis_vecs = [[0,0,0]]
cryst = Crystal(lat_vecs, basis_vecs)

# Create a spin [`System`](@ref) containing $L√óL$ cells. Selecting
# [`Units.theory`](@ref Units) with $g=-1$ provides a dimensionless Zeeman
# coupling of the form $-ùêÅ‚ãÖùê¨$.

L = 40
dims = (L, L, 1)
sys = System(cryst, dims, [SpinInfo(1, S=1, g=-1)], :SUN; seed=101)

# We proceed to implement each term of the Hamiltonian, selecting our parameters
# so that the system occupies a region of the phase diagram that supports
# skyrmions. The exchange interactions are set as follows.

J1 = -1           # Nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic
J2 = (2.0/(1+‚àö5)) # Tune competing exchange to set skyrmion scale length
Œî = 2.6           # Exchange anisotropy

ex1 = J1 * [1 0 0;
            0 1 0;
            0 0 Œî]
ex2 = J2 * [1 0 0;
            0 1 0;
            0 0 Œî]
set_exchange!(sys, ex1, Bond(1, 1, [1, 0, 0]))
set_exchange!(sys, ex2, Bond(1, 1, [1, 2, 0]))

# Next we add the external field,

h = 15.5
field = set_field!(sys, [0, 0, h])

# and finally an easy-plane single-ion anisotropy,

D = 19.0
set_onsite_coupling!(sys, S -> D*S[3]^2, 1)

# Initialize system to an infinite temperature (fully randomized) initial
# condition.

# We will study a temperature quench process using a generalized
# [`Langevin`](@ref) spin dynamics. In this SU(3) treatment of quantum spin-1,
# the dynamics include coupled dipoles and quadrupoles. Select a relatively
# small damping magnitude to overcome local minima, and disable thermal
# fluctuations.

damping = 0.05
kT = 0

# The first step is to determine a reasonable integration timestep. To determine
# this, we can initialize the system to some relatively low-energy
# configuration. A relatively large error tolerance of 0.025 is OK for this
# phenomenological study.

randomize_spins!(sys)
minimize_energy!(sys) # (this optimization does not need to converge)
integrator = Langevin(; damping, kT)
suggest_timestep(sys, integrator; tol=0.025)

# Apply the suggested timestep.

integrator.dt = 0.01

# Now run the dynamical quench starting from a randomized configuration. We will
# record the state of the system at three different times during the quenching
# process by copying the `coherents` field of the `System`.

randomize_spins!(sys)
œÑs = [4, 16, 256]   # Times to record snapshots
frames = []         # Empty array to store snapshots
for i in eachindex(œÑs)
    dur = i == 1 ? œÑs[1] : œÑs[i] - œÑs[i-1] # Determine the length of time to simulate 
    numsteps = round(Int, dur/integrator.dt)
    for _ in 1:numsteps                    # Perform the integration
        step!(sys, integrator)
    end
    push!(frames, copy(sys.coherents))     # Save a snapshot spin configuration
end

# To visualize the state of the system contained in each snapshot, we will
# calculate and plot the skyrmion density on each plaquette of our lattice. The
# function `plot_triangular_plaquettes` is not part of the core Sunny package,
# but rather something you could define yourself. We are using the definition in
# `plotting2d.jl` from the Sunny [`examples/extra`
# directory](https://github.com/SunnySuite/Sunny.jl/tree/main/examples/extra/Plotting).
