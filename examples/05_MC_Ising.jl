# # 5. Monte Carlo sampling of the Ising model
# 
# This tutorial illustrates simulation of the classical 2D Ising model.

using Sunny, GLMakie

# Sunny expects a 3D [`Crystal`](@ref) unit cell. To model a square lattice, we
# create an orthogonal unit cell where the $z$-spacing is distinct from the $x$
# and $y$ spacing.
a = 1
latvecs = lattice_vectors(a,a,10a,90,90,90)
crystal = Crystal(latvecs, [[0,0,0]])

# Create a [`System`](@ref) of spins with linear size `L` in the $x$ and $y$
# directions, and only one layer in the $z$ direction. The option `:dipole`
# means that the system will store Heisenberg spins, as opposed to SU($N$)
# coherent states. Polarize the initial spin configuration using
# [`polarize_spins!`](@ref). Following the Ising convention, we will restrict
# these spins to the $z$-axis and give them magnitude $S=1$.
# 
# By default, Sunny expects the magnetic field in tesla. Selecting
# [`Units.theory`](@ref Units) instead allows for dimensionless units. Following
# Ising conventions, select $g=-1$ so that the Zeeman coupling between external
# field $ùêÅ$ and spin dipole $ùê¨$ is $-ùêÅ‚ãÖùê¨$.
L = 128
sys = System(crystal, (L,L,1), [SpinInfo(1, S=1, g=-1)], :dipole, seed=0)
polarize_spins!(sys, (0,0,1))

# Use [`set_exchange!`](@ref) to include a ferromagnetic Heisenberg interaction
# along nearest-neighbor bonds. The [`Bond`](@ref) below connects two spins
# displaced by one lattice constant in the $x$-direction. This interaction will
# be propagated to all nearest-neighbors bonds in the system, consistent with
# the symmetries of the square lattice.
set_exchange!(sys, -1.0, Bond(1,1,(1,0,0)))

# If an external field is desired, it can be set using [`set_field!`](@ref).
B = 0
set_field!(sys, (0, 0, B))

# The critical temperature for the Ising model is known analytically.
Tc = 2/log(1+‚àö2)

# Use a [`LocalSampler`](@ref) to perform `nsweeps` Monte Carlo sweeps. A sweep
# consists of, on average, one trial update per spin in the system. Each
# proposed update is accepted or rejected according to the Metropolis acceptance
# probability. As its name suggests, the [`propose_flip`](@ref) function will
# only propose pure spin flips, $ùê¨ \rightarrow -ùê¨$.
nsweeps = 4000
sampler = LocalSampler(kT=Tc, propose=propose_flip)
