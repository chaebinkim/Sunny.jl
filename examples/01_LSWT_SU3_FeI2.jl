# # 1. Multi-flavor spin wave simulations of FeI‚ÇÇ (Showcase)
# 
# FeI‚ÇÇ is an effective spin-1 material with strong single-ion anisotropy.
# Quadrupolar fluctuations give rise to a single-ion bound state that cannot be
# described by a dipole-only model. This tutorial illustrates how to use the
# linear spin wave theory of SU(3) coherent states (i.e. 2-flavor bosons) to
# model the magnetic behavior in FeI‚ÇÇ. The original study was performed in [Bai
# et al., Nature Physics 17, 467‚Äì472
# (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-020-01110-1).

#
# The Fe atoms are arranged in stacked triangular layers. The effective spin
# Hamiltonian takes the form,
# 
# ```math
# \mathcal{H}=\sum_{(i,j)} ùêí_i ‚ãÖ J_{ij} ùêí_j - D\sum_i \left(S_i^z\right)^2,
# ```
#
# where the set of exchange matrices ``J_{ij}`` between bonded sites ``(i,j)``
# includes competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions. This
# model also includes a strong easy axis anisotropy, ``D > 0``.
# 
# We will formulate this Hamiltonian in Sunny and then calculate its dynamic
# structure factor.

# ## Get Julia and Sunny
# 
# Sunny is implemented in Julia. This is a relatively new programming language
# that allows for interactive development (like Python or Matlab) while also
# providing high numerical efficiency (like C++ or Fortran). New Julia users may
# wish to take a look at our [Getting Started with
# Julia](https://github.com/SunnySuite/Sunny.jl/wiki/Getting-started-with-Julia)
# guide. Sunny requires Julia 1.9 or later.
#
# From the Julia prompt, load `Sunny` and `GLMakie` for 3D graphics.

using Sunny, GLMakie

# If these packages are not yet installed, Julia should offer to install them
# using its built-in package management system. If old versions are installed,
# you may need to update them to run this tutorial.

# ## Crystals
#
# A [`Crystal`](@ref) describes the crystallographic unit cell and will usually
# be loaded from a `.cif` file. Here, we instead build a crystal by listing all
# atoms and their types.

a = b = 4.05012  # Lattice constants for triangular lattice
c = 6.75214      # Spacing in the z-direction

latvecs = lattice_vectors(a, b, c, 90, 90, 120) # A 3x3 matrix of lattice vectors that
                                                ## define the conventional unit cell
positions = [[0, 0, 0], [1/3, 2/3, 1/4], [2/3, 1/3, 3/4]]  # Positions of atoms in fractions
                                                           ## of lattice vectors
types = ["Fe", "I", "I"]
FeI2 = Crystal(latvecs, positions; types)

# Observe that Sunny inferred the space group, 'P -3 m 1' (164) and labeled the
# atoms according to their point group symmetries.

# Only the Fe atoms are magnetic, so we discard the I ions using
# [`subcrystal`](@ref).

cryst = subcrystal(FeI2, "Fe")

# Importantly, `cryst` retains the spacegroup symmetry of the full FeI‚ÇÇ crystal.
# This information will be used, for example, to propagate exchange interactions
# between symmetry-equivalent bonds.
#
# In a running Julia environment, the crystal can be viewed interactively using
# [`view_crystal`](@ref).

view_crystal(cryst)

# ## Symmetry analysis
#
# The command [`print_symmetry_table`](@ref) provides a list of all the
# symmetry-allowed interactions up to a cutoff distance.

print_symmetry_table(cryst, 8.0)

# The allowed $g$-tensor is expressed as a 3√ó3 matrix in the free coefficients
# `A`, `B`, ... The allowed single-ion anisotropy is expressed as a linear
# combination of Stevens operators. The latter correspond to polynomials of the
# spin operators, as we will describe below.
# 
# The allowed exchange interactions are given as a 3√ó3 matrix for representative
# bonds. The notation `Bond(i, j, n)` indicates a bond between atom indices `i`
# and `j`, with cell offset `n`. In the general case, it will be necessary to
# associate atom indices with their positions in the unit cell; these can be
# viewed with `display(cryst)`. Note that the order of the pair $(i, j)$ is
# significant if the exchange tensor contains antisymmetric
# Dzyaloshinskii‚ÄìMoriya (DM) interactions.
# 
# In the case of FeI‚ÇÇ, `Bond(1, 1, [1,0,0])` is one of the 6 nearest-neighbor
# Fe-Fe bonds on a triangular lattice layer, and `Bond(1, 1, [0,0,1])` is an
# Fe-Fe bond between layers. 

# ## Building a spin System

# In constructing a spin [`System`](@ref), we must provide several additional
# details about the spins.

sys = System(cryst, (4, 4, 4), [SpinInfo(1, S=1, g=2)], :SUN, seed=2)

# This system includes $4√ó4√ó4$ unit cells, i.e. 64 Fe atoms, each with spin $S=1$
# and a $g$-factor of 2. Quantum mechanically, spin $S=1$ involves a
# superposition of $2S+1=3$ distinct angular momentum states. In `:SUN` mode,
# this superposition will be modeled explicitly using the formalism of SU(3)
# coherent states, which captures both dipolar and quadrupolar fluctuations. For
# the more traditional dipole dynamics, use `:dipole` mode instead.

# Next we will use [`set_exchange!`](@ref) to assign interaction to bonds. Sunny
# will automatically propagate each interaction to all symmetry-equivalent bonds
# in the unit cell. The FeI‚ÇÇ interactions below follow [Bai et
# al](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-020-01110-1).

# # Calculating structure factor intensities

# In the remainder of this tutorial, we will examine Sunny's tools for
# calculating the dynamical structure factor using a [multi-boson
# generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.7731) of linear spin wave theory
# (LSWT). This theory describes non-interacting quasi-particle excitations that
# hybridize dipolar and quadrupolar modes.

# ## Finding the ground state

# Begin with a random configuration and use [`minimize_energy!`](@ref) to find a
# configuration of the SU(3) coherent states (i.e. spin dipoles and quadrupoles)
# that locally minimizes energy.

randomize_spins!(sys)
minimize_energy!(sys)

# A positive number above indicates that the procedure has converged to a local
# energy minimum. The configuration, however, may still have defects. This can
# be checked by visualizing the spins, colored according to their
# ``z``-components.

plot_spins(sys; color=[s[3] for s in sys.dipoles])

# A different understanding of the magnetic ordering can be obtained by moving
# to Fourier space. The 'instant' structure factor $ùíÆ(ùê™)$ is an experimental
# observable. To investigate $ùíÆ(ùê™)$ as true 3D data, Sunny provides
# [`instant_correlations`](@ref) and related functions. Here, however, we will
# use [`print_wrapped_intensities`](@ref), which gives average intensities for
# the individual Bravais sublattices (in effect, all wavevectors are wrapped to
# the first Brillouin zone).

print_wrapped_intensities(sys)

# The result will likely be approximately consistent with the known zero-field
# energy-minimizing magnetic structure of FeI‚ÇÇ, which is single-$Q$ (two-up,
# two-down antiferromagnetic order). Mathematically, spontaneous symmetry
# breaking should select one of $¬±Q = [0, -1/4, 1/4]$, $[1/4, 0, 1/4]$, or
# $[-1/4,1/4,1/4]$, associated with the three-fold rotational symmetry of the
# crystal spacegroup. In nature, however, one will frequently encounter
# competing "domains" associated with the three possible orientations of the
# ground state.

# If the desired ground state is already known, as with FeI‚ÇÇ, it could be
# entered by hand using [`set_dipole!`](@ref). Alternatively, in the case of
# FeI‚ÇÇ, we could repeatedly employ the above randomization and minimization
# procedure until a defect-free configuration is found. Some systems will have
# more complicated ground states, which can be much more challenging to find.
# For this, Sunny provides experimental support for powerful simulated annealing
# via [parallel tempering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_tempering),
# but that is outside the scope of this tutorial.

# Here, let's break the three-fold symmetry of FeI‚ÇÇ by hand. Given one or more
# desired $Q$ modes, Sunny can suggest a magnetic supercell with appropriate
# periodicity. Let's arbitrarily select one of the three possible ordering
# wavevectors, $Q = [0, -1/4, 1/4]$. Sunny suggests a corresponding magnetic
# supercell in units of the crystal lattice vectors.

suggest_magnetic_supercell([[0, -1/4, 1/4]])

# The system returned by [`reshape_supercell`](@ref) is smaller, and is sheared
# relative to the original system. This makes it much easier to find the global
# energy minimum.

# ## Linear spin wave theory
#
# Now that we have found the ground state for a magnetic supercell, we can
# immediately proceed to perform zero-temperature calculations using linear spin
# wave theory. We begin by instantiating a `SpinWaveTheory` type using the
# supercell.

# interpolation in reciprocal lattice units (RLU).

# between the provided $q$-points with a given `density`. The `xticks` return
# value provides labels for use in plotting.

# The [`dispersion`](@ref) function defines the quasiparticle excitation

# In addition to the band energies $œâ_i(ùê™)$, Sunny can calculate the inelastic
# neutron scattering intensity $I_i(ùê™)$ for each band $i$ according to an
# [`intensity_formula`](@ref). We choose to apply a polarization correction
# $(1 - ùê™‚äóùê™)$ by setting the mode argument to `:perp`. Selecting
# `delta_function_kernel` specifies that we want the energy and intensity of
# each band individually.

formula = intensity_formula(swt, :perp; kernel=delta_function_kernel)

# The function [`intensities_bands`](@ref) uses linear spin wave theory to
# calculate both the dispersion and intensity data for the provided path.

disp, intensity = intensities_bands(swt, path, formula);

# These can be plotted in GLMakie.

# This result can be directly compared to experimental neutron scattering data

#
# (The publication figure accidentally used a non-standard coordinate system to
# label the wave vectors.)
# 
# To get this agreement, the use of SU(3) coherent states is essential. In other
# words, we needed a theory of multi-flavored bosons. The lower band has large
# quadrupolar character, and arises from the strong easy-axis anisotropy of
# FeI‚ÇÇ. By setting `mode = :SUN`, the calculation captures this coupled
# dipole-quadrupole dynamics.
#
# An interesting exercise is to repeat the same study, but using `mode =
# :dipole` instead of `:SUN`. That alternative choice would constrain the
# coherent state dynamics to the space of dipoles only.

# The full dynamical spin structure factor (DSSF) can be retrieved as a $3√ó3$
# matrix with the [`dssf`](@ref) function, for a given path of $ùê™$-vectors.

disp, is = dssf(swt, path);

# The first output `disp` is identical to that obtained from `dispersion`. The
# second output `is` contains a list of $3√ó3$ matrix of intensities. For
# example, `is[q,n][2,3]` yields the $(yÃÇ,zÃÇ)$ component of the structure factor
# intensity for `nth` mode at the `q`th wavevector in the `path`.

# ## What's next?
#
# The multi-boson linear spin wave theory, applied above, can be understood as
# the quantization of a certain generalization of the Landau-Lifshitz spin
# dynamics. Rather than dipoles, this dynamics takes places on the space of
# [SU(_N_) coherent states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14125).
#
# The full SU(_N_) coherent state dynamics, with appropriate quantum correction
# factors, can be useful to model finite temperature scattering data. In
# particular, it captures certain anharmonic effects due to thermal
# fluctuations. See our [generalized spin dynamics tutorial](@ref "4.
# Generalized spin dynamics of FeI‚ÇÇ at finite *T*").
#
# The classical dynamics is also a good starting point to study non-equilibrium
# phenomena. Empirical noise and damping terms can be used to model [coupling to
# a thermal bath](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01265). This yields a Langevin
# dynamics of SU(_N_) coherent states. Our [dynamical SU(_N_) quench](@ref "6.
# Dynamical quench into CP¬≤ skyrmion liquid") tutorial illustrates how a
# temperature quench can give rise to novel liquid phase of CP¬≤ skyrmions.
